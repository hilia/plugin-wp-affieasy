== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is AffiEasy responsive? =

Sure, AffiEasy was designed to be responsive. As we saw it, our trafic is coming from mobiles by 60% ;)

= What is the difference with Table Maker? =

The plugin Table Maker is **no longer maintain**! We started from scratch for AffiEasy so you need to migrate your datas but you won’t regret it: with AffiEasy it’s very fast, the auto-affiliate links with your tracking code is really painless to build some new link and update it in seconds!
